# Project_VAST_FINK

Hi!

This is the Repository for the Winter Research Project that I'm doing with Anais Moller and Dougal Dobie. We're comparing the Radio and Optical data from crossmatched VAST and ZTF sources to see if we can find some new and interesting physics from transient sources, such as AGN, Supernovae, etc.

In this repository, you'll find some Jupyter Notebooks that show different stages in coding for the analyisis for these crossmatched sources. I will try to keep it as clean as possible and try not to add too many notebooks!
